# Higher-or-Lower-Android
Higher or lower is my very first Android app. The app generates a random number between 1 and 20 and the user is tasked with guessing it. If the user guesses incorrectly, the app provides them with a hint as to whether their guess was higher or lower than the correct number. If the user guesses correctly, the app congratulates them and generates a new number. The process goes on and on... it's all day fun!
